### So, how to use these Symbol?

* In the file, we have a file name `hyperion.conf`, in the first line of the file, is the `Source Language`

* And in the second line of the file, is the `Target Language`

* You can change it with you `text editor`

* Or, you can use this sofeware settings `dialog` to change it.


#### However, please note that the use of the `text editor` to change this file should be the same as the original file format.


### Steps

* The first step you should choose a source file which is `srt` file.

* If you want to use the default configuration, that is, the English to Chinese translation, you can click on the `Translation file` button now and wait a minntes.

* If not, you can refer to the `above steps` to modify the settings to achieve you intended purpose.

* In the end, if you use the default save location you will find that there is a directory called `Translation-result` in the current directory
